"""This module was developed to provide quick querying of structured
    files in which finding a substring in one line then requires the
    copying of that line and nearby lines to be saved to a new file.

    This was particularly designed for genetic sequencing data of the
    of the format:

        Tag line
        Genetic sequencing
        +
        Bar Code

    in which the second line (line = 2) is the line of interest, and all four line
    (n_line = 4) must be written to the new file.

    Other than the default values, there is no reason the structured data must
    conform.  Alterations can be made by adjusting line and n_line appropriately.

    This module assumes that the strings of interest (queries) that are sought
    to be found in the specified line (as substrings) are in a .txt file
    in which each line is one query:

        geneticSubsequence1
        geneticSubsequence2

    Currently, this module assumes this .txt file can be held in memory.

    Found substrings can be written into one file (tally=tally_all) or into 
    separate files (tally=tally_each).

    TODO: Add zip and unzip capabilities.
    TODO: Add auto execution on files in directory and subdirectories.
